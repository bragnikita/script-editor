This is the web interface for the GameScriptEditor service, that is using for online writing and posting of dialog-based stories (like visial novels or mobile game stories).

Tech stack I used: 
* [**ReactJS**](https://reactjs.org/) (Typescript) with hooks
* components from wunderful [**Semantic UI**](https://router5.js.org/)
* small and powerful [**mobx**](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management
* [**superagent**](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent) for ajax.
* clean and flexible [**router5**](https://router5.js.org/) for routing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
